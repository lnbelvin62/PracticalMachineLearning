# PracticalMachineLearning
This repository is for the course project for the
Coursera Practical Machine Learning Data Science course.

See ExercisePrediction.Rmd for the R Markdown analysis required
for the project.

See ExercisePrediction.html for the compiled HTML file produced
by knitting the ExercisePrediction.Rmd file.

**NOTE TO PEER REVIEWER**  
The ExercisePrediction.html file looks like a mess when I click on it.
I don't know what I did wrong.  The ExercisePrediction.Rmd file looks
correct.  Please review the ExercisePrediction.Rmd file.

There are two embedded figures:
